The survey also seeks to identify the barriers and drivers to certain practices (reading, playing, learning numbers, etc.) in order to inform a parent behavior change and communication campaign in Jordan. The survey cosists of mostly close-ended questions with specific choices for the enumerator to select from. Also, please note that the survey starts with time, date and location data, and then demographic information about the parent.\n",
